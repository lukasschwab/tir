The aim is to collect everything you read every day so you can find and share it. No more "I forget where I read it..."

This was supposed to be functionality that I'd build into ezrss, but I'm finding that difficult (because that would require scraping a whole bunch of text that is structured differently). There might be eventual integration, but not right now.

[Here](https://github.com/lukasschwab/tir/blob/master/tir.html) is an example template for an empty `tir.html`. I will keep it updated as tir changes.
